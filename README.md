# GC Hamster Kombat Clicker

## Description
'GC Hamster Kombat Clicker' is a C# Windows Form application designed to automate the clicking process in the game Hamster Kombat. This tool helps users earn tokens more efficiently by automating repetitive clicking tasks, including managing energy limitations within the game.

## Features
- Automated mouse clicking at user-defined intervals.
- Supports random clicking intervals (a random number between 1 and your defined value).
- Supports random click positioning (x-20 < random x value < x+20, y-10 < random y value < y+10).
- Calculates temporary pauses based on your 'earn per tap' value, 'energy level' value, and 'mouse click delay'.
- Supports auto stop by setting a specific time.
